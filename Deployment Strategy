managing my server or restful configuration for this function to work. i just want to execute the
function and get an output when needed, and aws lambda function is suitable for this.it is accessible from anywhere
and serverless applications are modular and independent.

The problem rises when we try to process larger and larger data. The process time becomes longer which is going to
be expensive as its charges with processing time. so the solution will be distributed systems where it can handle
large data. the problem here is going to be merging the output of the function in every node and getting one
output. from reading different articles using frameworks like hadoop can summarize our results.
